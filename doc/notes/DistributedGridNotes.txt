Notes on the Distributed Grid Implementation
--------------------------------------------

- Capture of visitor state doesn't work because we'd need to keep a running
  tally of visitor states, which completely serializes the operation and
  introduces lots of communication. The problem is that the visitors must
  accumulate state for each of the distributed children, and children may
  require the state accumulated from their siblings, so you'd need to capture
  the state, send it to rank 1, wait for rank 1, restore new state with
  accumulation of rank 1, capture send to rank 2 and repeat. This seems overly
  complicated to me.
